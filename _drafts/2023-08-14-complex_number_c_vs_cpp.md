title: "Complex number type: Why did C & C++ go separate ways?"
---

The fact that I can't use C style complex number APIs (`float complex`, `double complex`, etc) in C++17 code is very annoying.

Why did C++ create the `std::complex` template instead of just using C-style `complex` types?

TODO: Learn more about the reason & context..
