My first commit merged to LLVM master :)
  
  https://reviews.llvm.org/D112979

Later I submitted another NFC (non-functional-change) patch for review but no one responded,
which is understandable given that the commit contains too little change and brings almost
no merit to the codebase. I should not submit spam patches next time..
