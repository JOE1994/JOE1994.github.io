title: "Is PowerPC still relevant?"
---

## Who uses PowerPC nowadays?

I had this question whenever I saw LLVM bug tickets or code that mention "PowerPC".
Hopefully [this Quora Q&A](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-PowerPC-still-exist-Why-is-it-still-being-worked-on-and-deployed) answers my question:

Relevant quotes:

> IBM uses a follow-on architecture, POWER, in its supercomputers and mainframes.

> PowerPC is a dead architecture which is no longer in active development because the AIM alliance no longer exists.
  You might be thinking of the IBM POWER ISA which was derived from PowerPC.

> PowerPC is a very effective processor for high-performance server-based computing.

Aha! LLVM codegen tests like [`llvm/test/CodeGen/PowerPC/fma-mutate.ll`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/c1d0118459c814824b8a4c8f423b6b91d16af785/llvm/test/CodeGen/PowerPC/fma-mutate.ll) are still relevant for testing the [`IBM Power ISA`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_ISA).

Power ISA v3.1 (latest spec) was released in 2020.

[People still use the term powerpc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/up/up/stdarch/crates/core_arch/src/powerpc/vsx.rs.html), but to refer to Power ISA I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Documentation for Power ISA

There is [an official IBM website for hosting info related to the Power ISA](https://www-50.ibm.com/systems/power/openpower/welcome.xhtml).

The documents seem to be hosted by [`Box`](https://www.box.com/home) cloud, but at the moment the `Box` refuses to provide a download of the files for some reason üò∞

Hopefully I found [another link](https://wiki.raptorcs.com/w/images/f/f5/PowerISA_public.v3.1.pdf) that hosts the Power ISA v3.1 book (pdf).

## Learning Power ISA Instructions
Below are several Power ISA instructions I had to learn to fix a PowerPC codegen test at work.

### `vspltisw`: Vector Splat Immediate Signed Word
`vspltisw 2, -3` does the following:
```
# VSR   = Vector-Scalar Register. 64 VSRs available. VSR[32]~VSR[63] are for signed integers.
# EXTS32 = Sign extend to 32 bits

for (int i : [0, 3])
  VSR[2 + 32].word[i] = EXTS32(-3)
```

### `bc`: Branch Conditional
`bc 12, 2, .LBB0_2` does the following:
```
# CR = 32-bit "Condition Register"
# BI = 2
# BO = 12 (or 01100B)
  BO determines the condition under which the branch is taken.
  In this case, "branch if CR[BI] == 1"

if (CR[2] == 1)
  goto(.LBB0_2)
```

### `xstsqrtdp`: VSX Scalar Test for software Square Root Double-Precision
`xstsqrtdp 0, 1` does the following:
```
# CR  = 32-bit "Condition Register"
# VSR = Vector-Scalar Register.
Update CR[0] after inspecting VSR[1].dword[0] (double-precision floating-point value)
```

### `xsmuldp` : VSX Scalar Multiply Double-Precision
`xsmuldp 2, 1, 0` does the following:
```
# Simple double-precision multiplication using VSX registers.
VSR[2].dword[0] = VSR[1].dword[0] x VSR[0].dword[0]
```

### `addis` : Add Immediate Shifted
`addis 3, 2, .LCPI0_0@toc@ha` does the following:
```
# GPR : General Purpose Register
GPR[3] = GPR[2] + LSHIFT ( .LCPI0_0@toc@ha , 16 )
```

### `lfs` : Load Floating-Point Single
`lfs 4, .LCPI0_1@toc@l(3)` does the following:
```
# FRT: Floating-Point Register (32 FRTs available)
FRT(4) = *( EXTS64(.LCPI0_1@toc@l) + GPR[3] )
```

### `xvcvsxwdp` : VSX Vector Convert Signed Word to Double-Precision format
`xvcvsxwdp 2, 34` does the following:
```
for i in [0, 1] {
  VSR[2].dword[i] = CAST_I32_TO_F64 ( VSR[34].dword[i].word[0] )
}
```

### `fmr` : Floating Move Register
`fmr 5, 2` does the following:
```
# Store FRT[2] to FRT[5]
FRT[5] = FRT[2]
```

### `xsmaddadp` & `xsmaddmdp` : VSX Scalar Multiply-Add Double-Precision 
Type-A : `xsmaddadp`
`xsmaddadp 5, 3, 0` does the following:
```
VSR[5].dword[0] += VSR[3].dword[0] x VSR[0].dword[0]
```

Type-M : `xsmaddmdp`
`xsmaddmdp 2, 0, 3` does the following:
```
VSR[2].dword[0] = VSR[0].dword[0] x VSR[2].dword[0] + VSR[3].dword[0]
```


## Short Comments on Power ISA assembly
A bit unfamiliar in that, unlike X86_64 or ARM assembly where register names are used as operands, just the register indices are used as operands.
