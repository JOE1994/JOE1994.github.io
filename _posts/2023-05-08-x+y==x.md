For any real number `x` and any positive real number `c`, `x + c` is always greater than `x`.

In floating point arithmetic however, "`x + c == x`" can hold true in some cases.
```rust
// Doesn't panic! Try it in Rust Playground
assert!(std::f64::consts::PI + 1E-26 == std::f64::consts::PI);
```

Why does the above boolean expression hold true?
