title: "Floating Point Addition: X + C == X ?"
---

For any real number `X` and any positive real number `C`, `X + C` is always greater than `X`.

In floating point arithmetic however, "`X + C == X`" can hold true in some cases.
```rust
// Doesn't panic! Try it in Rust Playground
assert!(std::f64::consts::PI + 1E-26 == std::f64::consts::PI);
```

When doing *IEEE 754 Floating point addition* of floats X & C,
C (assuming exponent of C is less than exponent of X) is adjusted to have the same exponent as X,
and after that the addition is finally performed.

```rust
// HEX: 0x400921FB54442D18
const X: f64 = std::f64::consts::PI;
println!("0x{:X}", X.to_bits());
// BIN: 0b100000000001001001000011111101101010100010001000010110100011000
println!("0b{:b}", X.to_bits());

const C: f64 = 1E-26_f64;
// => HEX: 0x3A88C240C4AECB14
println!("0x{:X}", C.to_bits());
// => BIN: 0b11101010001000110000100100000011000100101011101100101100010100
println!("0b{:b}", C.to_bits());
```

**[float.exposed](https://float.exposed)** is a cool web-app that helps visualize and fiddle with bits of floating point numbers.
Using the app, it's easy to identify fields of a floating point number **(sign, exponent, significand)**.

* [X](https://float.exposed/0x400921fb54442d18) => 2^(1)​ * ​0b1.1001001000011111101101010100010001000010110100011000
* [C](https://float.exposed/0x3a88c240c4aecb14) => 2^(-87) * 0b1.1000110000100100000011000100101011101100101100010100
                                                => 2^(1) * (0b1.1000110000100100000011000100101011101100101100010100 >> 88)
                                                => 2^(1) * (0b0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000) (mantissa lost due to **Truncation Error**)

To add X & C, C's representation needs to be adjusted to have the identical exponent as X.
During adjustment, bits that consist mantissa of C is lost due to **Truncation Error**.
So that's why floating point addition `(X + C)` can equal `X`.

TODO: What are the exact steps that FPU hardware follow to implement floating point addition?
